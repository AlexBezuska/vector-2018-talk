## How did I find out about game jams?
- Started following indies on twitter
- Erin Robinson did the keynote for Global Game Jam 2013
- Video helped me me feel like I could do a jam
- No local event for Global Game Jam 2014
- Eric was down, we met the local game dev community at our local hacker space
- got the word out
- Formed a team with Eric and two people we had just Met
- finished a game I am still proud of


## Then a community formed
- The people at that jam became what we now call Louisville Makes Games

  - diverse

  - encouraging.
